# Example: DataFrame `df` should have columns: Track, Slice, X, Y

# Separate body parts by track number (adjust as needed)
head = df[df['Track'] == 0]
front_paw = df[df['Track'] == 1]

# Merge head and paw data by frame number (Slice)
merged = pd.merge(head, front_paw, on='Slice', suffixes=('_head', '_front'))

# Calculate delta X and Y (Y flipped because image Y increases downward)

# Calculate angle from horizontal axis in degrees

# Optional: Normalize to [-180, 180] if needed
merged['Angle_degrees'] = (merged['Angle_degrees'] + 180) % 360 - 180
